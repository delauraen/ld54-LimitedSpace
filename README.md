## Grocery Run

Everyone knows you **HAVE** to carry all your grocery bags in one trip or it doesn't count. Play as bag lady, carry as many groceries as you can handle but be careful because the more you carry the slower you move - you may need to dodge a rogue gang of geese that are out to steal those groceries. Get as many groceries to the end as quick as possible!

### Devlog

Another solo entry to Ludum Dare, I didn't accomplish as much as I originally wanted (per usual) but I did enjoy learning new things and felt a lot more comfortable in the 3D space. I may continue to iterate with the new 3 week option to see if I can get this into a more complete game.

Some additional notes:

- Picking up multiple items and storing them without an actual inventory system proved interesting. I ended up using the socket manager to fulfill this but quickly encountered may problems with this as you drop, the goose steals. Figuring out the collision/overlap logic was interesting.
